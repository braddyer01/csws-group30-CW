My visualisations rely on the tkinter, matplotlib and numPy libraries so they must be run in a python environment with said libraries installed.
Upon running the program, data will be presented to the user in both GUI and command line formats after a visualisation is selected.
Also ensure that the "english premier league data.csv" and "favicon.ico" files are within the scope of the program; this should not be a problem if the program is run through a cloned github repository.
