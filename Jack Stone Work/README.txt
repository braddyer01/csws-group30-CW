My visualizations requires: NumPy, MatPlotLib and Tkinter libraries, these libraries are required for the code to run properly
When the user runs the program, they should be met with a screen that allows them to pick the first, then second team and then finally the type of visualization
It is required for the user to have the "english premier league data.csv" for the file to run properly
